        <h2>The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square</h2>
        <p>
            _The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
            the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
            _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
            up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
            lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
            tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
            Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
            entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
            heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
            MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
            together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
            fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
            _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.
            MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="speech">suppose so.  Are you?</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why</p> I
go anywhere.

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>  <p class="speech"> don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="speech">How very trivial of him!</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <P class="speech">About myself.</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Languidly_.]</p>  <p class="speech">And were you interested?</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Not in the smallest degree.</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="speech">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Rising_.]</p>  <p class="speech">And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>


<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="speech">We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h6> <p class="stage_directions">[_Superciliously_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my
schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.</p>

<h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Coldly_.]</p>  <p class="speech">I am not surprised!</p>
