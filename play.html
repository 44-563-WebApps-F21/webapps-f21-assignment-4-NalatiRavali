        <h2>The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square</h2>
        <p>
            _The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
            the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
            _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
            up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
            lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
            tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
            Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
            entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
            heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
            MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
            together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
            fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
            _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.
            MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?

LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?

MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?

LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
go anywhere.

MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.

LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!

MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.

LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.

MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!

LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?

MRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.

LADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?

MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.

LADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!

MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!


LADY CHILTERN.  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.

MRS. CHEVELEY [_Superciliously_.]  Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my
schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.

LADY CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  I am not surprised!
