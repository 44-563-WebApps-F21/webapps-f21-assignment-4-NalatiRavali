    <h6>An Ideal Husband</h6>
    <h2>The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square</h2>
    <p>
        _The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_. _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_. _She receives the guests as they come
        up_. _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_. _On the right is the
        entrance to the music-room_. _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
        heard_. _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_. MRS.
        MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
        together on a Louis Seize sofa_. _They are types of exquisite
        fragility_. _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
        _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.
        MRS. MARCHMONT. Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

    <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p class="speech">suppose so. Are you?</p>

    <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

    <h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why</p> I
    go anywhere.

    <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p class="speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

    <h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

    <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p class="speech">So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
        here to try to find one.</p>

    <h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p class="stage_directions">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>
    <p class="speech"> don’t see
        anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.</p>

    <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p class="speech">How very trivial of him!</p>

    <h6 class="LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?</p>
